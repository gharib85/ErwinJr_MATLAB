% The program take a 2D matrix that contains column number of 1D vectors. 
% It calulates the norm square value of each of the 1D vector and return as
% a 1D vector with size of the column nmber.
function normV = normSqu(matrix)
columnNum = size(matrix, 2);  % number of 1D to be computed
    for i = 1 : columnNum
        normV(i) = matrix(:, i)' * matrix(:, i);
